# ADT
This code base includes three source files: AdptArray.c, book.c, and Person.c.

AdptArray.c contains functions that implement an adaptive array data structure that can store elements of arbitrary type using generic pointers. The data structure has a variable size and can be dynamically resized as needed.

book.c contains functions that define a book data type, including functions for creating, copying, deleting, and printing book objects.

Person.c contains functions that define a person data type, including functions for creating, copying, deleting, and printing person objects.

The code makes use of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and function pointers to provide generic and flexible data structures and data types.

## to usage:
- git clone url
- make clean 
- make run
- to run memory test --> make mem_test
